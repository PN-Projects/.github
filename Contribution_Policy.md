# ü§ù Contribution Policy ‚Äî pn-projects

_Last Updated: May 2025_

This **Contribution Policy** defines how contributors at all levels engage with pn-projects. It aligns fully with our [Constitution](../pn-projects_full_constitution.md), [Code of Conduct](../pn-projects_full_code_of_conduct.md), and [Promotion Framework](../pn-projects_promotion_policy.md). It ensures sustainable growth, mentorship, transparency, and a clear pathway from first PR to core leadership.

This document is **non-negotiable** and **central to membership evaluation**.

## 1. üå± Philosophy of Contribution <a name="1"></a>

Contributions are not just lines of code. They include:
- Suggestions and issue creation

We believe every contribution, when done with honesty and professionalism, moves our ecosystem forward. Our ladder of growth ‚Äî from contributor to CMDO ‚Äî is built on consistent, reliable contribution.
